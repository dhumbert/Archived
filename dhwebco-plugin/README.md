# dhwebco WordPress Plugin Base

This is a work-in-progress. After developing WordPress plugins for a while, I've decided that I need to abstract out some of the common functionality that I find myself implementing over and over.

I realize there are many other similar projects on GitHub, BitBucket, the WordPress plugin repository, etc. I am not trying to break new ground here, just to create something that helps *me*. Feel free to use it if you'd like.

**Documentation coming soon!**
